`Cyber Security Tools â€“ Advanced mini Projects`
These four advanced projects demonstrate practical defensive security techniques: a Brute-Force Simulator shows how password-guessing attacks work (safely, on local hashes), an IDS watches network traffic for suspicious patterns, a Secure Chat app implements end-to-end encryption for private messaging, and a Web Vulnerability Scanner runs non-invasive checks (HTTPS, headers, robots.txt) to spot common site weaknesses.

`brute_sim.py`
Demonstrates how brute-force attacks work by trying to guess weak passwords safely.

`simple_ids.py`
Monitors network traffic and flags unusual patterns that indicate possible intrusions.

`server.py & client.py`
Implements end-to-end message encryption between two users using AES or RSA.

`vuln_scanner.py`
Scans websites for common security flaws like SQL Injection or XSS vulnerabilities.
