<!-- Cyber Security Tools – Advanced mini Projects -->
These four advanced projects demonstrate practical defensive security techniques: a Brute-Force Simulator shows how password-guessing attacks work (safely, on local hashes), an IDS watches network traffic for suspicious patterns, a Secure Chat app implements end-to-end encryption for private messaging, and a Web Vulnerability Scanner runs non-invasive checks (HTTPS, headers, robots.txt) to spot common site weaknesses.

`Brute Force Attack Simulator` brute_sim.py
Demonstrates how brute-force attacks work by trying to guess weak passwords safely.

`Intrusion Detection System (IDS)` simple_ids.py
Monitors network traffic and flags unusual patterns that indicate possible intrusions.

`Secure Chat Application (Encrypted Messaging)` server.py & client.py
Implements end-to-end message encryption between two users using AES or RSA.
how to run:-  cd '.\Advanced Projects\Secure Chat Application (Encrypted Messaging)' and server.py and client.py

`Web Vulnerability Scanner` vuln_scanner.py
Scans websites for common security flaws like SQL Injection or XSS vulnerabilities.
