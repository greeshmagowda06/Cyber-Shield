`Cyber Security Tools – Intermediate Projects`
This set of Python projects enhances system and data protection through automation and analysis. The Keylogger Detector identifies suspicious background processes, the File Encryption Tool secures sensitive files, the Network Packet Sniffer monitors network activity, and the Malware Hash Checker detects infected files using hash comparison. Together, they demonstrate practical ways to strengthen cyber defense using simple code.

`keylogger_detector.py`
Scans running system processes and alerts if any resemble known keylogger names.

`encrypt_decrypt.py`
Encrypts and decrypts files securely using the cryptography library to prevent unauthorized access.

`packet_sniffer.py`
Captures and displays 10 network packets to help users observe how data travels across a network.

`hash_checker.py `
Generates a file’s hash and compares it to a list of known malicious hashes to detect possible malware.
