`A Collection of Basic Cyber Security Tools`
Cyber security protects computers and data from online threats. These simple Python projects — Password Checker, Phishing Detector, Port Scanner, and Log Analyzer — show how coding helps in finding weak passwords, fake links, and security risks.

`password_checker.py`
Checks if a password is strong by analyzing its characters, length, and symbols.

`phishing_detector.py`
Scans a given URL for phishing indicators like fake domains or suspicious keywords.

`port_scanner.py`
Scans a list of common network ports to detect which ones are open or closed.

`firewall_analyzer.py & sample_log.txt`
Reads firewall logs and flags any entries with blocked, denied, or failed access attempts.
