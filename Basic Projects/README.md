<!-- A Collection of Basic Cyber Security Tools -->
Cyber security protects computers and data from online threats. These simple Python projects — Password Checker, Phishing Detector, Port Scanner, and Log Analyzer — show how coding helps in finding weak passwords, fake links, and security risks.

`Password Strength Checker` password_checker.py 
Checks if a password is strong by analyzing its characters, length, and symbols.

`Phishing URL Detector` phishing_detector.py
Scans a given URL for phishing indicators like fake domains or suspicious keywords.

`Simple Port Scanner` port_scanner.py
Scans a list of common network ports to detect which ones are open or closed.

`Firewall Log Analyzer` firewall_analyzer.py
Reads firewall logs and flags any entries with blocked, denied, or failed access attempts.
